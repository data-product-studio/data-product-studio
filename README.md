# Data Product Studio
## An [Apache 2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), open-source tool that walks teams through a simple step-by-step process to create data products more efficiently and protect data management quality. Our mission is to help your teams create, collaborate, and communicate better.

Why the Data Product Studio was needed:
- Teams operate in silos, leading to poor data management. Garbage in, garbage out
- There is a need for translation from business processes to lower and lower technical levels
- Better collaboration leads to better communication and better results
- Data quite often doesn't have proper metadata and semantic management, which wastes time
- Clarkston wants to help our clients have better data management and we want to make it as easy and low-risk as possible for them to see results
- The Data, Digital, and Analytics team is passionate about contributing to open source software

### The Projects page enables you to search for any entities used by your data, software, and analyst teams. On the left are the steps your teams will take to ensure high-quality data products and prevent and/or eliminate a lot of issues we see that arise from poor data management.

### Searching for entities is greatly aided when someone can add a context filter to the search. A data scientist might need taxonomy or database contextual results, whereas a business analyst might need business logic design.

### The first step is for a data product manager / business domain owner to list the objective and key results for their data product (or an Epic & user stories if preferred). Every person / team involved with creating a data product needs to get on the same page. The goal of the Objectives page is to facilitate communication, NOT to merely create tickets.

### It is the job of the business analyst to convert the business domain owner's needs into psuedo code or even actual code that can be executed. This experience is meant to create collaborative communication, to ensure everyone agrees in theory to how things are represented properly.

### When we define data visualizations we need to specificy any code sources (if JavaScript is used, for example), and any data sources (such as an API endpoint), and what the medium will be (Tableau, PowerBI, custom / D3, for example).

### Defining APIs are important because our data schemas act like 'data contracts', giving us the structure of the data returned, and our metadata is tagged with an "@" symbol with a reference to a taxonomical URL so that the meaning of the data is included with the data itself.

### Having clear documentation around what databases and what tables is pretty foundational, and yet oftentimes teams don't have an easy way to get an answer. If it is documented at all it could be in a PDF 5 levels deep in a shared directory. The Data Product Studio is meant to be a living document, a centralized source of truth for effective collaboration.
