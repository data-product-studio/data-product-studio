# Data Product Studio 
### An [Apache 2](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), open-source license collaboration tool that walks teams through a simple process to create data products.

Why the Data Product Studio was needed:
- Teams operate in silos, leading to poor data management. Garbage in, garbage out
- There is a need for translation from business processes to lower and lower technical levels
- Better collaboration leads to better communication and better results
- Data quite often doesn't have proper metadata and semantic management, which wastes time
- Clarkston wants to help our clients have better data management and we want to make it as easy and low-risk as possible for them to see results
- The Data, Digital, and Analytics team is passionate about contributing to open source software
