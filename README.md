# Clarkston Consulting's Data Product Studio
## An Open-Source Data Product Management & Data Experience Tool
### You have talent in place, now let’s unleash it with a step-by-step product management methodology that simplifies your systems and workflows to unlock value.
### Our North Star is to help your teams create, collaborate, and communicate better.

![Methodology](https://github.com/data-product-studio/data-product-studio/blob/main/images/Data_Product_Methodology.png)

Why the Data Product Studio was needed:
- Teams operate in silos, leading to poor data management. Garbage in, garbage out
- There is a need for translation from business processes to lower and lower technical levels
- Better collaboration leads to better communication and better results
- Data quite often doesn't have proper metadata and semantic management, which wastes time
- Clarkston wants to help our clients have better data management and we want to make it as easy and low-risk as possible for them to see results
- The Data, Digital, and Analytics team is passionate about contributing to open source software

# 10 STEPS TO UNLOCK HIGHER PERFORMANCE FOR YOUR DATA TEAMS

## 1. DATA PRODUCT MANAGEMENT
### Setting objectives that create business value,  performance reviews of systems and their efficiencies, understanding our users of data (internal and/or external)
![Objectives](https://github.com/data-product-studio/data-product-studio/blob/main/images/Objectives.png)
The first step is for a data product manager / business domain owner to list the objective and key results for their data product (or an Epic & user stories if preferred). Every person / team involved with creating a data product needs to get on the same page. The goal of the Objectives page is to facilitate communication, NOT to merely create tickets.


## 2. BUSINESS LOGIC TRANSLATION
### Business and developer teams need to understand the logic used in plain language. This enables handing off the descriptions to developer teams to implement, and enables business teams to have a clear understanding of what the developer teams are building.
![Logic](https://github.com/data-product-studio/data-product-studio/blob/main/images/Logic.png)
It is the job of the business analyst to convert the business domain owner's needs into psuedo code or even actual code that can be executed. This experience is meant to create collaborative communication, to ensure everyone agrees in theory to how things are represented properly.


## 3. SEMANTIC MANAGEMENT
### Data dictionaries, key business concept glossaries, taxonomies, schemas, etc., are all various ways companies can manage their concepts. Companies need a URL they can point to in order to look up the definition of concepts, and column names, and their structure.

## 4. DATA SOURCES & DATA MODELING
### Document which tables and columns contain data relative to the objectives of the data project. Capture why architects made certain data modeling choices, pros & cons.
![data_sources](https://github.com/data-product-studio/data-product-studio/blob/main/images/data_sources.png)
Having clear documentation around what databases and what tables is pretty foundational, and yet oftentimes teams don't have an easy way to get an answer. If it is documented at all it could be in a PDF 5 levels deep in a shared directory. The Data Product Studio is meant to be a living document, a centralized source of truth for effective collaboration.

## 5. QUERY COOKBOOKS
### Clearly defining business questions and the queries used to answer them will create modular building blocks for your teams to build data products. Centralize a repository for your queries with good documentation so that there is clear data lineage, and reusability.

## 6. APIs & DATA CONTRACTS
### Metadata references need to be included with the transmission of data. This will save teams a tremendous amount of time, allowing them to quickly understand what property definitions are. Additionally, we want clearly defined API catalogs to make it as easy as possible for efficient data management.
![API](https://github.com/data-product-studio/data-product-studio/blob/main/images/API.png)
Defining APIs are important because our data schemas act like 'data contracts', giving us the structure of the data returned, and our metadata is tagged with an "@" symbol with a reference to a taxonomical URL so that the meaning of the data is included with the data itself.

## 7. VISUALIZATION VOCABULARY
### It’s important to choose the visualization to tell your data story. An intent catalog and design rationale will enable better communication and understanding of how and why data is visualized in a certain way. The goal is to promote thoughtfulness in design choices so that the insight can be intuitively, obviously, and quickly understood.

## 8. KPI BUILDER
### Now we are ready to create our KPIs, as we’ve gone through all of the steps necessary to design and build high-quality measures & metrics that can drive better decision-making and enable informed value creation. All of the previous steps come together to catalog, create, and code your KPIs.
When we define data visualizations we need to specificy any code sources (if JavaScript is used, for example), and any data sources (such as an API endpoint), and what the medium will be (Tableau, PowerBI, custom / D3, for example).

## 9. GOVERNANCE
### Manage who has access to your data products and what rules & regulations your data products need to be compliant with.

## 10. QUALITY CONTROL & TESTING
### How will your team reflect on the value of KPIs, how will things be tested before being released into production, and are there ways to detect data corruption? How can future members of the team hold a retrospective and connect the dots?

## DATA PRODUCT MANAGEMENT WILL MITIGATE AND PREVENT SOME OF YOUR GREATEST PAIN POINTS IN DATA.FOLLOW THESE STEPS FOR HIGH QUALITY DATA PRODUCTS AND EFFECTIVE DATA TEAMS

## CONTEXTUAL SEARCH
### Searching for entities is greatly aided when someone can add a context filter to the search. A data scientist might need taxonomy or database contextual results, whereas a business analyst might need business logic design.
