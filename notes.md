## Storing Database Credentials
This demo includes a database that stores sample HR Data. The data can be found at https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-sample-database. We stored this data in a local postgres SQL DB. The credentials for this database should be stored in file named secrets.toml inside the .streamlit folder. The .streamlit folder is gitignored. Additioanlly, a config.toml file can store streamlit configurations such as theme.
